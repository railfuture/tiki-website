Bikes on trains rulesThe National Conditions of Carriage, issued by National Rail, show that most folding bikes qualify as part of a passenger’s free luggage allowance. Each passenger can carry up to three items of luggage, two measruring up to 90cm x 70cm x 30cm and weighing 50kg apiece and one smaller bag measuring up to 55cm x 40cm x 20cm, with a weight limit of 50kg.Larger items, up to a meter cube and weighing up to 50kg or 150cm x 150cm x 100cm and weighing up to 75kg can be carried if there is room but are liable to a fee “not exceeding half the adult fare”.Bicycles, tricycles, tandems and recumbents are not covered by the Conditions of Carriage  but are left to individual train operating companies to decide.You can download the full National Rail Conditions of Carriage [http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/nrcc/|here]
